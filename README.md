# Python Project Template

A modern Python project template with best practices for development and collaboration.

## Features
- 🚀 Fast dependency management with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- ✨ Code formatting with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
- 🔍 Type checking with [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- 🧪 Testing with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)
- 🐳 Docker support for development and deployment
- 👷 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Python Version
This template defaults to Python 3.12, but you can use any version supported by uv. To use a different version:

```bash
# List available Python versions
uv python list

# Use a specific version (e.g., 3.11)
make setup PYTHON_VERSION=3.11  # or UV_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11 make setup

# View installed Python versions
uv python list --installed
```

uv will automatically download and manage Python versions as needed.

## Quickstart
```bash
# Clone this repo and change directory
git clone git@github.com:safurrier/python-collab-template.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name

# Install dependencies and run the initialization script
make setup
uv run python scripts/init_project.py

# Follow the prompts to configure your project
```

This will:
- Clean up example code
- Initialize a fresh git repository
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Update project metadata

Alternatively, you can set up manually:
```bash
# Install dependencies and set up the environment
make setup

# Run the suite of tests and checks
make check

# Optional: Remove example code to start fresh
make clean-example
```

## Development Commands

### Quality Checks
```bash
make check      # Run all checks (test, mypy, lint, format)
make test       # Run tests with coverage
make mypy       # Run type checking
make lint       # Run linter
make format     # Run code formatter
```

### Example Code
The repository includes a simple example showing:
- Type hints
- Dataclasses
- Unit tests
- Modern Python practices

To remove the example code and start fresh:
```bash
make clean-example
```
## Docker Support

### Development Environment
```bash
make dev-env    # Start a development container
```

This creates a container with:
- All dependencies installed
- Source code mounted (changes reflect immediately)
- Development tools ready to use

### Production Image
```bash
make build-image    # Build production image
make push-image     # Push to container registry
```
